# Sentiment Network

This project is my first deep learning project. I have created a neural network from scratch. First, I have created network and later i have optimized the network with reducing the number of inputs given to the neural network. Also updated the 1st layer of the neural network and removed the input nodes with that were giving 0 in the input node.

This project is a Sentiment Analysis project. A binary classification project giving the positive and negative reviews. The data is from the IMDB movie reviews and this data is opensourced. The project data has the "reviews.txt" file and "labels.txt". The reviews file contains all the reviews from the viewers  and the label contains reviews as positive and negative. 
The data in the reviews is messy and is handled while I was transforming the data into a vectorized format.
